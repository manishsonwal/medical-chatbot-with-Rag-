Medical RAG Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered Medical Chatbot that uses 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, 
context-aware answers to health-related questions according to data.

It is built using LangChain, FAISS (vector database), and Hugging Face 
enabling the chatbot to understand, retrieve, and generate responses from 
real medical data such as The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine.
